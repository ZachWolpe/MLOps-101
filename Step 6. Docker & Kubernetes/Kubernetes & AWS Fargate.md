# Kubernetes & AWS Fargate

AWS Fargate complements Kubernetes by providing a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both `Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)` and `Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)`.

### AWS Fargate
- **Serverless**: Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers. It allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of servers.

- **Integration**: Fargate integrates with ECS and EKS. With ECS, it abstracts server management completely. With EKS, it allows you to run Kubernetes without having to manage the underlying server infrastructure.

- **Use Case**: Ideal for users who want to focus on application development without the overhead of scaling and managing servers.

### Kubernetes (EKS when on AWS)

- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration tool that manages the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications across a cluster of machines.

- **Flexibility and Control**: Provides more control over how applications run and how they are managed, which can be crucial for complex applications.
Community and Ecosystem: Benefits from strong community support and a vast ecosystem of tools and extensions.

### Relationship and Use Cases

- **Fargate with EKS**: You can use Fargate as a compute engine for EKS, which combines the ease of serverless deployment with the powerful orchestration capabilities of Kubernetes. This setup is particularly useful for users who want the benefits of Kubernetes without the complexity of node management.
Direct Fargate Use: Alternatively, you can use Fargate directly with ECS for simpler applications or when you do not need the full orchestration capabilities of Kubernetes.

In summary, Fargate does not replace Kubernetes but provides an alternative way to deploy containers that can reduce the operational burden associated with managing physical servers and clusters, and it can be used in conjunction with Kubernetes through EKS for a serverless Kubernetes experience.
