# Docker vs Virtual Machine (VM)

### Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization technology.
Containers encapsulate an application with all its dependencies but share the kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host os.
Docker containers are more lightweight, start much faster, and use a fraction of the memory compared to VMs.

### Virtual Machine (VM)

A VM is an emulation of a computer system that provides the functionality of a physical computer.
VMs run on top of a physical machine using a hypervisor. Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries, and libraries - taking up tens of GBs.
VMs can run multiple operating systems on one physical server, but each VM is completely isolated and essentially functions as a separate computer.

### Key Differences

- **Performance**: Containers require less system resources than VMs because they share the host system's kernel with other containers rather than requiring a hypervisor to emulate hardware.

- **Startup Time**: Containers typically start in seconds, whereas VMs can take minutes to boot up their operating systems.

- **Resource Isolation**: VMs provide more robust and complete isolation thanks to the hypervisor. Containers, while isolated, share the host system's kernel.

- **Portability**: Containers are more portable across different systems and cloud environments compared to VMs.

- **Use Cases**: VMs are better for running applications that require full isolation and are resource-intensive, while containers are ideal for applications where seamless integration and resource efficiency are more critical
